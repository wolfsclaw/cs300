<p><b>What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?</b></p>
<p>Data arrives from many different places in an “as‑is” state, which means it’s often inconsistent, disorganized, and not immediately usable. Sorting algorithms help bring order to that chaos by arranging the information efficiently while minimizing the load on system resources. In the course projects, the core challenge was determining which algorithms handled this cleanup most effectively—both in terms of speed and computational cost.</p>
<p>A practical example was a client who needed their course catalog displayed cleanly inside a professional software application. That required reading the raw CSV file, storing the information in a suitable structure, presenting it in a polished interface, and making the entire catalog searchable so users could quickly find what they needed.
</p>
<p><b>How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.</b></p>
<p>Each requirement was divided into a clear, manageable task, and I evaluated three different data structures to see how effectively each one could store, organize, and search the course data. By testing them side‑by‑side, I compared their insertion speed, search performance, and overall efficiency, which made it easier to determine which structure handled the messy CSV input most reliably while keeping system demands low.</p>
<p><b>How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?</b></p>
<p>I relied on W3Schools and Zybooks throughout the project to guide both my coding and my analysis. These resources provided clear explanations, examples, and references that helped me understand how to structure the program, apply the correct syntax, and evaluate the behavior of different data structures. They also offered practical demonstrations that made it easier to compare performance and ensure that my implementation aligned with best practices.</p>
<p><b>How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?</b></p>
<p>I’ve reached a point where I’m not just able to store or access data, but truly interact with it and build systems that let users engage with the information however they need. Developing skills like organizing data, making it searchable, and creating user‑friendly ways to explore it has shown me that I can shape data into something functional and intuitive. These are practical, marketable abilities that translate directly into real software development work.</p>
<p><b>How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?</b></p>
<p>This experience really reinforced for me how powerful it is to break functions and methods down into small, focused pieces. The same core logic can be reused across different data storage types, much like how you apply similar coding patterns in different programming languages. The key is to clearly understand the requirements, then move forward in deliberate, manageable steps, almost like taking “baby steps” through the problem until the full solution emerges.</p>
